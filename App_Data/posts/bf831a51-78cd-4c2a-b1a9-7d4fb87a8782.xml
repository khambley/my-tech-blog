  <content>&lt;p&gt;Scrum is a type of software development methodology (describes how things should be done in an organization), where a project is developed in modules, or "chunks" called a&amp;nbsp;sprint, lasting anywhere from 1 week to 6 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the sprint, the team conducts short, focused Daily Meetings that usually only last up to 15 minutes and report the individual team member's progress and game plan for that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to say, I've worked for a manager that embraced this methodology and I really like it! Especially the Daily Meetings. One of my former managers would do a "walkabout" throughout the department in the morning, and talk about our projects and progress and what our game plan was for the day. I really liked that, it gave me focus for the day and set the expectations of what I was to accomplish that day. Very cool! If I become a manager, I would totally implement this Daily Meeting strategy with my team.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
