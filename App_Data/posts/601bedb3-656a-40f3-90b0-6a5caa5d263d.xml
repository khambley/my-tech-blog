  <content>&lt;p&gt;Yep, I'm creating my very own Minecraft Mod and I'm learning the Java language with Eclipse IDE at the same time. I've always wanted to learn Java, at least the basics and I thought this would be a perfect way to do that. I found an online course, mainly geared towards kids but adults can sign up too. It's called Youth Digital. Here is the link: &lt;a href="http://www.youthdigital.com"&gt;www.youthdigital.com&lt;/a&gt;. I'm taking Mod Design 1. It's pretty fun! I love Minecraft! I think all this online learning is great, it's really come a long way since I was in school. ;)&lt;/p&gt;</content>
